# Wake Word for less than $10 on the Raspberry Pi Pico

![](/images/post_images/yes_no_gif.gif "Raspberry Pi Pico Wake Word")

I recently put a project up on [Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/hlsw/pico-wake-word-1e2372), you can learn how to create a less than $10 wake word. 
You can also learn how to port the wake word app to a different board you may have lying around as I go through the techniques required to get this working on 
the Pico.
