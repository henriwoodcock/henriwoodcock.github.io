# Star Wars Super Resolution with TVM and OpenCL

> On this May the 4th, why not watch the original Star Wars trilogy in 4k on your single board computer with Super Resolution and TVM.

I'm one day late to putting this on my blog! (Revenge of the fifth?)

I recently put a new project up on GitHub to celebrate May the 4th. I thought,
why do we keep fighting about which Star Wars copy is the best? Why not just
make them all Super HD?

Star Wars day aside, we are not quite ready to be streaming Super Resolution on
small low-powered single-board computers (just yet anyway). However, I hope this
project really shows you the simplicity and potential of TVM for deploying
neural networks on these small devices.

Here we built TVM for an Arm Mali GPU using OpenCL on an Odroid N2+. Please go
to my GitHub
[repository](https://github.com/henriwoodcock/star-wars-super-resolution) to
test it out yourself and feel free to make any changes or improvements and
share them with me!

Arm's a huge contributor to TVM so hopefully by next Star Wars day we'll have
SuperSuper Resolution. Although, I'm not sure I can fit the monitor that size
in my bedroom!

If you want a more indepth deep-dive into the code and how it was all made, be
sure to read the blog post that I also put in the repository
[here](https://github.com/henriwoodcock/star-wars-super-resolution/blob/main/blog/README.md).
