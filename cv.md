## Projects
### Automatic Asset Classification \[[Report](https://henriwoodcock.github.io/2020/06/07/Automatic-Asset-Classification/)\] \[[Github](https://github.com/henriwoodcock/automatic-asset-classification)\]

This project uses neural networks to classify flood defence assets and achieves an accuracy of 90%. Clustering is then used to extend this with underlying asset attributes.
