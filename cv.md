## Projects
### Applying Modern Best Practices to Autoencoders [report](https://henriwoodcock.github.io/2020/04/05/Autoencoders-best-practices/) [github](https://github.com/henriwoodcock/Applying-Modern-Best-Practices-to-Autoencoders)
This project applies some of the modern best practices found in other parts of image data research (such as classification and super-resolution) to autoencoders. The result is compressing an image into a vector of size 1000 and still being able to classify images (with a trained classifier) to high accuracy. The use of these techniques massively improved a baseline autoencoder and create visually pleasing results.
### Machine and Deep Learning for Stock Price Prediction: Comparison of Classification and Regression Techniques [report](https://henriwoodcock.github.io/2020/03/21/stock-price-prediction-project/) [github](https://github.com/henriwoodcock/Stock-Price-Prediction)
Part of my final year project at University of Leeds. The objective of this report was to compare the use of classification and regression models from Machine and Deep Learning to predict the price trend of a stock. The report discusses feature selection, model selection and comparison, and discusses and compares the effects of different dataset sizes as well as the impacts from the use of autoencoders. 12 Models are compared, and finds the best model is a Recurrent Neural Network predicting trend correctly 55.46% of the time (a profit-making level).
