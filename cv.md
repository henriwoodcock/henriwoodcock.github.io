### Education
- University of Leeds, BSc Mathematics with Finance, 2016-2019. Grade __1st Class__
- Final Year Project: Machine and Deep Learning for Stock Price Prediction: Comparison of Classification and Regression Techniques

### Experience

- ARM, Technical AI Evangelist, 2020 - present

- Jacobs Engineering, Asset Management Consultant, 2019 - 2020
     - Proposed and developed a neural network to predict fatigue damage on mooring lines. Use of a neural network cut down computation time by days compared to using the current model while keeping accuracy.
     - Verifying a neural network (with PyTorch's Captum) which was developed by the team, gave the team confidence in the model and led to further investment into work with neural networks.
    - Automation of identify linear assets from data of Thames Estuary. Usually looked through manually, I applied statistical concepts to find geospatial anomalies which I classified as assets. Big data, tens of millions of points analysed.
    - Analysis of data to help cluster customers to create targeted advertisements. Hypothesis testing, visualisations, clustering, binary classification/regression.
    - Automated the updating of a Hydraulic Model in Python with visualisation of changes between current model and new data and created a health score for each individual parameter. This allowed modellers to cut down their time to important parts of the model, this process use to be done manually with every parameter checked.

### Projects

- Automatic Asset Classification \[[Report](https://henriwoodcock.github.io/2020/06/07/Automatic-Asset-Classification/)\] \[[Github](https://github.com/henriwoodcock/automatic-asset-classification)\]
    - _Classify flood defence assets to 90% accuracy._
    - _Clustering algorithms applied to images to find underlying similarities which could lead to automating attributes to asset data._
- Applying Modern Best Practices to Autoencoders \[[Report](https://henriwoodcock.github.io/2020/04/05/Autoencoders-best-practices/)\] \[[Github](https://github.com/henriwoodcock/Applying-Modern-Best-Practices-to-Autoencoders)\]
    - _This project applies some of the modern best practices found in other parts of image data research to autoencoders._
- Machine and Deep Learning for Stock Price Prediction: Comparison of Classification and Regression Techniques \[[Report](https://henriwoodcock.github.io/2020/03/21/stock-price-prediction-project/)\] \[[Github](https://github.com/henriwoodcock/Stock-Price-Prediction)\]
    - _The objective of this report was to compare the use of classification and regression models from Machine and Deep Learning to predict the price trend of a stock._
