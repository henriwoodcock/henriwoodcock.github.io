### Education
- University of Leeds, BSc Mathematics with Finance, 2016-2019. Grade __1st Class__
- Final Year Project: Machine and Deep Learning for Stock Price Prediction: Comparison of Classification and Regression Techniques
------------
### Experience
 - Jacobs Engineering, Asset Management Consultant, 2019 - Present
     - Developed a neural network in PyTorch to a high accuracy which reduced the reliance on the current model which can take weeks to run. The neural network can make predictions in seconds.
     - Used PyTorch's Captum to analyse a current in use neural network model, giving the project management validation and security the model's behaviour was similar to engineering principles.
    - Automated the updating of a Hydraulic Model in Python with visualisation of changes between current model and new data and created a health score for each individual parameter. This allowed modellers to cut down their time to important parts of the model, this process use to be done manually with every parameter checked.
    - Automation of identify linear assets from data of Thames Estuary. Usually looked through manually, I applied statistical concepts to find geospatial anomalies (assets). Big data, tens of millions of points analysed.

### Projects
- Automatic Asset Classification [Report](https://henriwoodcock.github.io/2020/06/07/Automatic-Asset-Classification/) [Github](https://github.com/henriwoodcock/automatic-asset-classification)
    - Classify flood defence assets to 90% accuracy.
    - Clustering algorithms applied to images to find underlying similarities which could lead to automating attributes to asset data.
- Applying Modern Best Practices to Autoencoders [Report](https://henriwoodcock.github.io/2020/04/05/Autoencoders-best-practices/) [Github](https://github.com/henriwoodcock/Applying-Modern-Best-Practices-to-Autoencoders)

This project applies some of the modern best practices found in other parts of image data research to autoencoders.

- Machine and Deep Learning for Stock Price Prediction: Comparison of Classification and Regression Techniques [Report](https://henriwoodcock.github.io/2020/03/21/stock-price-prediction-project/) [Github](https://github.com/henriwoodcock/Stock-Price-Prediction)

The objective of this report was to compare the use of classification and regression models from Machine and Deep Learning to predict the price trend of a stock.
