## 2021 Review

2021 was a good year and outside of these goals I managed to get a new job
which I am much happier with and had a lot of fun outside of work. The downsides
being I struggled to find times for my goals and did not managed to keep up my
fitness.

2021 was a lot more fun than the previous year and I managed to:
- go on holiday
- move house
- go to a festival
- go out a lot more
- move job and go to the office more
- write several blog posts

Hopefully now I am a little more settled I can make 2022 more of a goal
achieving year.

1. Finish an app

    In 2021 I had started multiple app ideas but never got round to finishing one
    and never finished any I had previously started. So this is an unsuccessful
    goal, but one that I still want to pursuit.

2. Start a business

    This will always be a goal until I achieve it. I had several ideas for this one
    and a couple which I am still currently thinking of or have started working on,
    so hopefully we'll see this one ticked off soon.

~~3. Read more than 2020 (atleast 1 book then)~~

    First goal done, although this may be cheating. I am currently 3/4 ways through
    a book which is sadly more than 2022. I started reading in November (I'm not
    very fast) so would like to keep this up.

4. Run more (264.2km)

    Not even close, 134km this year. I sort of gave up when lockdowns fully ended,
    but this is definitely going into 2022 as I can feel myself slowly getting more
    and more unfit.

~~5. Run a 10km~~

    Do not think I could do this right now, but completed this on 23rd January.
    10km with a pace of 5:50/km, giving me a sub 1 hour 10km so fairly happy with
    this one.

6. Monthly blog post

    Ok, this one started well and then went a bit downhill. 5 posts (including
    my most popular ever which is good), so almost half a point. I've lost my
    interest in blogging so may not want to aim so high this year.

7. Lose weight

    Cannot say much about this one as I did not even track it, but I was fairly
    constant, although writing this just after christmas is not very convincing.

8. Eat healthier

    This started off well but then came the takeaways and late nights throughout
    the year!

9. Work on more personal projects

    Not as much as I wished! No points :(

10. Contribute to kaggle more

    Again, no points here. I've lost interest in data science, so I'm not upset
    by this one.

~~11. Make my first open source contribution~~

    Yes! And to no other than TensorFlow! 19 constributions to TensorFlow
    repositories and 8 to Arm repositories. I am pretty pleased with this, I won't
    set this as another goal but I will definitely continue and increase this.

~~12. Understand my passion / develop a vision~~

    So this year I moved to a tech startup and have thoroughly enjoyed it. Not
    sure if it's a passion but I am definitely enjoying it and would love to start
    my own tech startup one day.

~~13. Travel more (go away covid)~~

    I saw a bit of the UK, a lot of London and managed to go abroad. Hopefully
    I can do more abroad next year, but going to check it off!

14. Get involved in research / researh more

    Nope, but I have lost interest in this slightly. Maybe this will be a goal
    in the future.

15. Write a paper

    Nope, see above.

16. Learn more vim

    Yes! I've been using vim almost exclusively (installed the vscode plugin)
    and must say I am loving it.

~~17. Understand blockchain / bitcoin~~

    Yes, but I no longer believe it in. I won't get into that here, maybe I'll
    write that down some day.

18. Live abroad

    Nope, but this is definitely still a life goal, maybe I should not have set
    that this year.

~~19. Become more confident~~

    I would say so. I've met many new people, hosted multiple workshops
    (for Arm), presented many presentations (also for Arm) and got a lot more
    involved in talking to different teams and people in my two jobs. Pretty
    good going for me compared to before.

~~20. push myself in my career~~

    Yes, I love my new job and managed to get it against all odds.

## 2022 Goals

My goals this year will be less life goals, I maybe did it wrong last time as
these can not always be achieved in one year even if you are working on it.

1. Work on a business idea / product
    - sub goal here could be start a company
2. Push myself in my career and try climb the ladder
3. Run more / be more active
    - sub goal beat 2020s 256km and actually join a gym again
4. Get more revenue streams to help escape 9-5 one day
5. Work on my mental and physical health
6. Cook more, eat less takeaways and eat healthier
7. Read more
    - sub goal beat 2021s 3/4 of a book!
8. Think more before speaking
9. Be a better listener
